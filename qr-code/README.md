## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I was able to expierment with Next.js a little. Additionally, I opted to style this without Tailwind. Although Next has Tailwind I wanted to take advatange of this practice and work on my CSS classes. 

I created custom classes for each CSS element I used starting with the main container: 

```css
.container {
  /* Desktop */
  position: absolute;
  display: flex;
  width: 1440px;
  height: 800px;
  /* Light Grey */
  background: #d5e1ef;
}
```

The individual values are pulled directly from the Figma Design document. Many of the values you see are boxes sized from the master design document. 



### Continued development

This is a great baseline for practice frontend work. 

### Useful resources

- [Next.JS Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Document for Next.Js reference and setup. 
- [CSS Refersher](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - We all know this. Since I was ensuring I stepped away from Tailwind here. 
- [CSS Refersher](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - More CSS 
- [React](https://react.dev/reference/react) - Frontend React Reference used to help me pick how I would start this.
